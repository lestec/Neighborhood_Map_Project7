# Neighborhood Map App Project

This is the final project (#7) of the Udacity's FEND Grow with Google Nanodegree program of 2018.

#### Overview

Project 7 was to create an app that uses a Map API and other venues type API's to show locations on a map via markers with a filtered
list of those locations. 
This project uses React, Google Maps, and Foursquare API 
(https://developer.foursquare.com/) to present a map
and markers of places to get coffee in Las Vegas
(esp after a long night or early morning in Vegas).
